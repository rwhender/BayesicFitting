BayesicFitting
==============
Bayesian model fitting and evidence calculation.
------------------------------------------------


<!--
Fitting is about finding a model, a mathematical relation, that best
represents the data. Data is obtained in some measurement where at 
location `x` a value `y` is found.  
It is achieved by minimizing the distance between the model and the data.
-->


It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Bayesian ways to
perform inference from data. If not, there are enough books on the
market that explain what it is about. E.g. [[Sivia][1], [Bishop][2],
[von der Linden][3] and [Jaynes][4]](#refs).

The BayesicFitting toolbox can be used to fit data to a model *and* to 
find the model that fits the data best. The first goal is achieved by
optimizing the parameters of the model in light of the data present. For
the second goal the evidence is calculated, either as a Gaussian
approximation, or in case of NestedSampler by integrating over the 
posterior.

Quick Start
-----------

The easiest way to get started with this package is to look into the 
[examples](../examples) directory and find an example that looks like
the problem to be solved.

To run the examples start a notebook by typing 

    jupyter notebook

in the examples directory. Select the example in the list that appears in
the browser. Copy and edit the example until it works on the problem at hand.

## 1. Introduction

The toolbox contains over 100 classes. Each class forms an object that
encapsulates several methods. The name of the class is a good
indication of the functionality of the object it generates. E.g.
**PolynomialModel** generates a **Model** object that yields a polynomial of a
selected order, etc. Similarly there are collections of **Fitter**s,
**ErrorDistribution**s, **Prior**s and **Engine**s. 

Each class and all of its methods are fully documented, using document
strings.

The classes can be divided into 3 broad categories **Model**s,
**Fitter**s and classes pertaining to the **NestedSampler**. 

<a name="imports"></a>
## 2. Imports 

All classes must be imported with

    from BayesicFitting import SomeClass

or of course with

    from BayesicFitting import *

which imports all classes. In the remainder of this manual it is assumed 
that all necessary imports have been performed in the code listed.


<a name="models"></a>
## 3. Models 

A model is a class that encapsulates a relation between independent 
variable, parameters and a dependent variable. 
The independent variable is called **x** (or `xdata`); de parameters are 
indicated as **p** and the dependent variable is called **y** (or `ydata`).
The relation between them is a mathematical function **f**.

> **y = f(x:p)**

The result of the function together with its derivatives, parameter
values, and other possibly usefull information is packed into the
class. 

Assuming that `m` is a **Model**, all following attributes and methods are 
defined.

    np = m.nrpars                       # number of parameters in the model
    p = m.parameters                    # list of parameters of the model
    nd = m.ndim	                        # number of dimensions in the model
    r = m.result( xdata, pars )         # results of f(xdata:pars)
    r = m( xdata )                      # short for m.result( xdata, p )
    dfdp = m.partial( xdata, pars )     # partial derivative of f to p
    dfdx = m.derivative( xdata, pars )  # derivative of f to x
    name = m.__str__()                  # name of the model as a string
    parname = m.parNames                # list of parameter names


### Dimensionality.

Most **Model**s are 1-dimensional i.e. they require a 1-dimensional
input vector. Two- or more-dimensional models need 2 or more numbers for
each result it produces. One could think of fitting  maps or cubes. The
results of any model is always a 1-dimensional vector.

In general, models of different dimensionality cannot be combined.

### Simple Models.

Simple models are objects that are created by invoking one model class.

    m1 = PolynomialModel( 1 )
    m2 = GaussModel()

Both `m1` and `m2` are simple models. The first assumes a linear relation 
between `xdata` and `ydata`.

> **f(x:p) = p<sub>0</sub> + p<sub>1</sub> * x**

It has 2 parameters that can be optimized to fit the `ydata`.

The second model `m2` encapsulates the function

> **f(x:p) = p<sub>0</sub> * exp( -0.5 * ( ( x - p<sub>1</sub> ) / p<sub>2</sub> )<sup>2</sup> )**

It has 3 parameters to be fitted.

A simple model is a **Model**, i.e. all actions valid for **Model**s can be 
done with simple models.

<a name="fixedmodel"></a>
### Fixed Models.

Upon construction of a simple model the value(s) of one or more
parameters can be fixed.  Either with a constant value, turning the
model into one with less parameters, or with another **Model**. In the
latter case the parameter is changing as the **Model**. Results and
derivatives are constructed from the interacting models.

A keyword argument, `fixed=<dictionary>`, is used to construct a fixed
model. The dictionary consist of an integer key, indicating the
parameter index, and  a float value for fixing the parameter with a
constant, or a **Model** value for replacing the parameter by the model.
In the former case the fixed model has one parameter less than the original
model. In the latter case, the parameters of the replacing model are appended
to the parameters of the fixed model which also is one parameter less than
the original.

    m1 = PolynomialModel( 1, fixed={0:0.0} )	# line through origin
    m2 = GaussModel()
    m3 = ArctanModel( fixed={0:m2} )		# Gauss-modulated arctangus
    # Build a series of models of increasing polynomial order.
    pm1 = PolynomialModel( 1 )                  # 1st order
    pm2 = PolynomialModel( 1, fixed={1:pm1} )   # 2nd order
    pm3 = PolynomialModel( 1, fixed={1:pm2} )   # 3rd order
    # etc. But not as efficient as PolynomialModel( 3 )

See also the [mrs-fringes example](../examples/mrs-fringes.ipynb).

and ArctanModel (green).
</td></tr>
</table>

Fixed models are non-linear, except when the model is linear and the
parameters are fixed with constants.

A fixed model is a **Model**, i.e. all actions valid for **Model**s can be 
done with fixed models.


### Compound Models.

**Model**s can be combined by various operations (+, -, *, /, |) into a new
(compound) model. 
The 4 arithmetic operators do the obvious: they take the results of both 
models and apply the operation. 
For compound models the (partial) derivatives, (parameter) names etc are 
properly defined.

All operations are also available as assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, |=).


#### Addition (+)
To construct a gaussian emission line on a linearly changing background:

    m4 = PolynomialModel( 1 ) + GaussModel()


#### Subtraction (-)
To construct an absorption line with a voigt profile on a constant background:

    m5 = PolynomialModel( 0 ) 
    m5 -= VoigtModel()

<td style="width: 50px;">  </td>
<td style="width: 350px;">

</td></tr>
</table>


#### Multiplication (*) 
Using multiplication an alternative for m3 can be written as: 

    m6 = ArctanModel( fixed={0:1.0} ) * GaussModel() 

Note that without the fixed keyword in ArctanModel, `m6` would be
degenerate as both models have an amplitude parameter. By fixing one of
them to 1.0 the model avoids degeneracy.


#### Division (/)
To construct the inverse of **(p<sub>0</sub> + p<sub>1</sub> * x<sup>2</sup>)**:

    m7 = ConstantModel( values=1 ) / PolynomialModel( 2, fixed={1:0.0} )

<table><tr>
<td style="width: 50px;">  </td>
<td style="width: 350px;">

</td></tr>
</table>


#### Pipe (|)

A special operation that can be applied to two models 
is the pipe, indicated by |. It acts like the (unix) pipe: the
result of the left-hand model is used as input of the right-hand model.

This is the only place where a 2-d model can be combined with a 1-d
model as the output of a 2-d model is 1 dimensional.

In the FixedModels paragraph a gauss modulated arctan model was
constructed. In that model the gauss and the arctan had its own x-shift
parameter.  Both parameters were set to the same value in Figure 2,
making a balanced wave function. 

To force them being the same, the x-shift parameters in both models are
fixed to 0. Then x is shifted linearly and it is piped through the other
models. 

    m10 = ArctanModel( fixed={0:1.0,1:0.0} ) * GaussModel( fixed={1:0.0} )
    m11 = PolynomialModel( 1, fixed={1:1.0} ) | m10

<td style="width: 50px;">  </td>

</table>

Compound models are **Model**s and can be combined with other (compound)
models into a new model. This way quite complicated models can be formed
without worrying about internal consistency. 
See the [gaussfit example](../examples/gaussfit.ipynb).

Compound models are non-linear
unless all its constituents are linear and its operations are additive.

A compound model ia a **Model**, i.e. all actions valid for **Model**s can be 
done with compound models.

### Brackets

The models in a chain are processed, from left to right. There is no
adherence to operation preferences. However, when a *compound* model is
appended to a chain, the appended model is considered as a single unit.
It gets a set of brackets around it. If `m1`, `m2` and `m3` are all
models, then 

    m = m1 * m2
    m += m3

is different from

    m = m1
    m *= m2 + m3

The first is processed as `( m1 * m2 ) + m3` while the second is processed
as `m1 * ( m2 + m3 )`. The brackets are introduced implicitly. 
This feature was used in the piping example above.
Explicit placement of brackets can be done with **BracketModel**.

### ConstantModel

The **ConstantModel** returns the same (constant) result no matter what 
the input. The result can be a single value (0, 1 or whatever) or the 
result of another **Model** with known parameters or even a table.

The **ConstantModel** has no parameters and strictly speaken, it can not
be fitted. It states that the the data, except for the constant form, is
mere noise.  It might seem a useless class, but it can be interesting in
model comparison. E.g. to decide whether some feature is present or not.

    m1 = ConstantModel( value=1.5 )
    m2 = ConstantModel( fixedModel=ExpModel( params=[1.0, -2.0] ) )


### CombiModel

A **CombiModel** combines a number of repetitions of the same model,
possibly with relations of same parameters.

    gm = GaussModel()               # model to be repeated
    ac = {1:[0,1.4,2.7,3.6]}        # add connection of par[1] (centers)
    mc = {2:[1,1,1,1]}              # mul connection of par[2] (widths)
    m12 = CombiModel( gm, nrepeat=4, addCombi=ac, mulCombi=mc )

In the example case above all gauss widths are the same and the lines
have a fixed separation. The remaining parameters are
[amp0, center, width, amp1, amp2, amp3].

### Kernel Models

**KernelModel**s encapsulate kernel functions into a model. A kernel
function is a an even integrable function. It is bound if the function
value is 0 everywhere except for a region around zero.

    km1 = KernelModel()                     # default: Biweight
    km2 = KernelModel( kernel=Cosine() )
    km3 = KernelModel( kernel=Tophat( 0 ) )
    km4 = KernelModel( kernel=Tophat( 1 ) )
    km5 = KernelModel( kernel=Tophat( 4 ) )

Figure 7 shows examples of KernelModels. The Biweight kernel is in blue;
the Cosine in green. The remaining 3 are 0, 1 and 4 convolutions of Tophat.
</td></tr>
</table>

**SincModel** is actually defined as a **KernelModel** with a Sinc kernel.
Both **GaussModel** and **LorentzModel** could be defined in the same
way, but are not.

Two dimensional kernel models also exist: **Kernel2dModel**. They come is
3 varieties: circular, elliptic and rotated.

    km6 = Kernel2dModel( kernel=Gauss )
    km7 = Kernel2dModel( kernel=Gauss, shape='elliptic' )
    km8 = kernel2dModel( kernel=Gauss, shape='Rotated' )

<!--
**Model**s come into 2 varieties: those that are linear in its
parameters and those that are not. The former have great advantages as
they can be fitted directly to the data; the latter always need an
iterative fitting approach. 
-->

<a name="fitters"></a>
## 4. Fitters 

A **Fitter** is an algorithm that minimizes the errors **&epsilon;**,
the differences between the data, **y**, and the model, **f(x:p)**.

> **&epsilon; = y - f(x:p)**

The best fit is found through optimization of the parameters **p**.
Traditionally this is done by finding the minimum of
**&chi;<sup>2</sup>**, the sum of the squared errors. This least-squares
method is computationally simple, especially if **f** is a linear
function in its parameters **p**. These problems can be solved by (the
equivalent of) one matrix inversion.
Non-linear least-squares methods also exist. They are more demanding and
require iterative methods to arrive at the minimum. 

Other methods focus around the likelihood, which is maximized. Maximum
likelihood is attained when the errors are minimal.
Several likelihood functions are available in BayesicFitting. They are
called [**ErrorDistribution**](#list-errdis).
Using the **GaussErrorDistribution** is equivalent to using the
least-squares method.
 

<!--
A fitter tries to find the minimum in the &chi;<sup>2</sup> landscape,
cq. the maximum in the likelihood landscape, as a function of the model
parameters. The values for the parameters where the minimum cq. maximum
in the landscape is found are the least-squares solution resp. the
maximum-likelihood solution. If the likelihood is Gaussian the two are
the same. 

#### data.

Data is a one dimensional vector (array) of measured points that are to
be compared with the model. The misfit is minimized when using
&chi;<sup>2</sup>, or the likelihood of the model parameters, given the
data is maximized.
-->

### Weights.

Up on fitting, weights can be provided as a vector of the same length as
the data vector. 
The behaviour of the fitter is such
that when a point has a weight of n, this is equivalent to a case where that
particular point is present in the dataset n times. This concept is
extended to non-integral values of the weights.<br>
Weights could be derived from the standard deviations in a previous
calculation. In that case the weights should be set to the inverse
squares of the stdevs. However weights do not need to be inverse
variances; they could be derived in any other way. One specially usefull
feature of the use of weights, is that some weights might be set to zero,
causing those points not to contribute at all to the fit.

As weights are obviously more flexible that standard deviations, weights
are preferred in BayesicFitting, throughout.


### Linear Fitters.

As with **Model**s there are two kinds of **Fitter**s, linear an
non-linear ones for linear and non-linear **Model**s resp. 

The landscape for linear models is monomodal i.e. it has only
one (global) minimum. The linear fitter has generally no problem finding
this minimum in one direct matrix conversion. It is fast and efficient.
This package has 2 linear fitters: **Fitter** and **QRFitter**.

    xdata = numpy.asarray( [1.0, 1.3, 1.5, 1.8, 2.0] )
    ydata = numpy.asarray( [3.2, 3.9, 3.7, 4.0, 5.6] )
    model = PolynomialModel( 1 )        # suppose liner relation 
    ftr = Fitter( xdata, model )        # define the fitter
    par = ftr.fit( ydata, plot=True )   # optimal values for parameters

<td style="width: 350px;">
Figure 9. A simple linear fit. The black dots are the data,
the red line is the model and the green line a one-sigma
confidence region.
</td></tr>
</table>

### Non-linear Fitters.

For non-linear models the &chi;<sup2</sup>-landscape can be complicated.
It can have many minima of which only one is the deepest. That is the
one the fitter should find. Non linear fitters search for a gradient in
the landscape to descend into the valley. Wherever a minimum is found,
most fitters get stuck. There are several strategies to search the
landscape but all of them are iterative. There is no single best
strategy. It depends on the problem and on knowledge of the starting
values for the parameters. This package has a dozen  non-linear fitters.

Some non-linear fitters are strictly least-squares, others can be used as
maximum likelihood fitters too.

    xdata = numpy.asarray( [ 0.0, 1.0, 1.3, 1.5, 1.8, 2.0, 3.0] )
    ydata = numpy.asarray( [-1.2,-0.9,-0.3, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.8] )
    wgts  = numpy.asarray( [ 0.5, 2.1, 0.9, 1.3, 1.2, 0.8, 1.1] )  # weights
    model = ArctanModel( )    
    ftr = LevenbergMarquardtFitter( xdata, model )  # define the fitter
    par = ftr.fit( ydata, weights=wgts )            # optimal parameters

<table><tr>
<td style="width: 50px;">  </td>
<td style="width: 350px;">

</td></tr>
</table>

### Maximum Likelihood Fitters.

**LevenbergMarquardtFitter** and **CurveFitter** are strictly least
squares fitters. Other non-linear fitters like **AmoebaFitter** and the
**ScipyFitter**s can also be used as **MaxLikelihoodFitter**s. 
The maximize the [likelihood](#list-errdis) selected for the fitter.

    ftr = AmoebaFitter( xdata, model, errdis='laplace' )

See the [summerdays example](../examples/summerdays.ipynb).


### Fitter Results.

When an optimal solution for the parameters has been found, a number of
methods, all inherited from **BaseFitter**, are available to calculate
[standard deviations](./glossary.md/#stdev), 
[noise scale](./glossary.md/#noise), 
[&chi;<sup>2</sup>](./glossary.md/#chisq), 
[confidence regions](./glossary.md/#confidence)
and the [evidence](./glossary.md/#evidence). 

    par   = ftr.parameters           # optimal parameters (same as above)
    stdev = ftr.stdevs               # standard deviations on parameters
    covar = ftr.covariance           # covariance matrix
    chisq = ftr.chisq                # chisq at the optimal params
    scale = ftr.scale                # remaining noise scale
    yfit = ftr.getResult()           # fitted model values
    yfit = model( xdata )            # same as previous
    yband = ftr.monteCarloError()    # 1-sigma confidence region

All items above are more or less derived from the covariance matrix at
the optimal parameter location.

### Evidence.

The evidence can only be calculated when the limits on the parameters
are provided. And when the noise scale is fitted too, also for the
scale. [Priors](.glossary.md/#prior) for the parameters are assumed to
be Uniform, for the scale it is JeffreysPrior.

It is up to the user to make sure that the optimal parameters and noise
scale are well within the limits provided. Otherwise the gaussian evidence
calculation is invalid.

    limits = [-100.0,100.0]             # either 2 floats: all pars same limit. Or
    lo = [-100.0, 0.0, 10.0]            # lower limits for the parameters
    hi = [+100.0, 100.0, 20.0]          # upper limits for the parameters
    limits = [lo,hi]                    # or 2 lists of floats
    noiselim = [0.01, 10]               # limits on noisescale; all > 0
                                        # the 10-log evidence is obtained as:
    evidence = ftr.getEvidence( limits=limits, noiseLimits=noiselim )

When in the above examples `model` has more than 3 parameters, the last limit
is repeated for all remaining cases. 

There is a lot of mumbo-jumbo about priors. Formally, it is a
representation of the knowledge about the problem before the data is
taken into account. In abstracto one could imagine that there is no
prior knowledge. In such cases the determination of priors seems highly
subjective. However, in real life problems there are always limits
on what can be measured in sensitivity, spectral range, duration,
location etc. And consequentially on what values the parameters can attain. 

See [example on model comparison](../examples/modelcomparison.ipynb) or
[harmonicfit](../examples/harmonicfit.ipynb) for demonstration of the use of
evidence to determine the best model.
For instructions on when to optimize the noise scale too, see
[noise2 example](#../examples/noise2.ipynb). 
For a demonstration on the influence of noise on model selection see
[noise1 example](#../examples/noise.ipynb).

### Keep fixed.

The **Fitter**s have the option to keep one or more parameters fixed
during the fitting proces.
It can be done in the construction of the fitter 

    fitter = SomeFitter( xdata, model, keep={key:value} )

to fix the parameter for the lifetime of the fitter.
Or in the fit method itself.

    params = fitter.fit( ydata, keep={key:value} )

to fix the parameter for this fit only.
In both case key is a parameter index and value is a float at which
the parameter should be fixed.

Note that [fixing the parameter in the model](#fixedmodel) replaces
a parameter permanently with the chosen value. 

See the [fix parameters example](../examples/fix-parameters.ipynb) for
the suble differences between fixing the model, the fitter or the fit.. 

### Two or more dimensions.


Sometimes the independent input `xdata` has more than 1 dimension. Then
a 2 or more dimensional models is required for a fit. The input,
`xdata`, is of the form array[N,D], where D is the number of dimensions
and N is the number of D-dimensional points. If N = 1 it can collapse to
array[D].

When the data to be fitted has the form of a map, or a cube, the `xdata`
still need to be an enumeration of all pixels. **ImageAssistant**
extracts the necessary `xdata` from the map, and converts the map values
in 1-d `ydata`. It is silently invoked by the fitter when the keyword
map is set.

    y = numpy.zeroes( (3,4), dtype=float )  # some empty map 
    mdl = PolySurfaceModel( 0, 0 )
    fitter = Fitter( y, mdl, map=True )     # use y here as xdata
    print( fitter.xdata.shape )             # show shape of internal xdata
    > [12,2]
    pars = fitter.fit( y )                  # use y here too, now as ydata
    print( fitter.yfit.shape )              # show the shape of the result
    > [3,4]                                 # same as the original map y
    print( mdl( fitter.xdata ).shape )      # the model however, returns  
    > [12]                                  # a 1-d version of y

See [simplemap](../examples/simplemap.ipynb) for more about the use of the
keyword "map". And [randommap](../examples/randommap.ipynb) for random
observation in a 2-d object and about the explicit use of
**ImageAssistant**.   

### Robust fitting.

A special fitter is **RobustShell**. It is a shell around any other
fitter. **RobustShell** iteratively de-weights outlying points. It makes
the fit more robust in the presence of a minority of outliers i.e.
points that should not partake in the fit. The de-weighting process is
governed by one of the [kernels](../source/kernels).

    np = 101                                # 
    xdata = numpy.linspace( 0, 1, np )      # make 101 datapoints
    ydata = numpy.linspace( 0.3, 0.5, np ) + 0.3 * numpy.random.rand( np )
    no = 20                                 # 20 outliers
    out = numpy.asarray( np * numpy.random.rand( no ), dtype=int )
    val = 1 * numpy.random.rand( no )
    ydata[out] += val                       # at random place, value
    pm = PolynomialModel( 1 )               
    ftr = Fitter( xdata, pm )               
    par0 = ftr.fit( ydata )                 # simple fit
    rft = RobustShell( ftr )
    par1 = rft.fit( ydata )                 # robust fit
    rwgt = rft.weights                      # resulting robust weights

Robust fitting is even more dangerous than ordinary fitting. Never trust
the results without thorough checking.

suppression of irrelevant points.

## 5. NestedSampler 

**NestedSampler** is a novel technique to do Bayesian calculations.  It
samples the Posterior while integrating it to calculate the evidence.
The evidence and the samples from the posterior are the main results of
NestedSampler. From the samples, the optimal values for the model
parameters, its standard deviations etc can be calculated.

**NestedSampler** applies an ensemble of walkers, initially evenly
distributed over the prior probability. Then an iterative process is
started. Every iteration the walker with the lowest likelihood is
discarded and replaced by a copy of one of the remaining walkers. The
copied walker is wandered around randomly by one or more **Engine**s, 
provided it keeps a higher likelihood than the value of the discarded
walker. This way the ensemble of walkers stays randomly distributed over
the prior while the ensemble as a whole slowly ascends the likelihood
to the top. The discarded walker is kept as a sample of the posterior,
appropriately weighted.

**NestedSampler** uses a **Prior** for the initial distribution and an
**ErrorDistribution** to calculate the likelihoods.

Nested sampling is an idea of David McKay and John Skilling.


**NestedSampler** needs more information to run tahn ordinary
**Fitter**s. It needs priors for all  its parameters and it needs a
likelihood function. We start off defining some data. 

    xdata = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
    ydata = [0.2, 1.3, 4.5, 1.4, 0.1]

Set up the model with limits on the uniform priors of the parameters.

    model = GaussModel()
    lolim = [-10.0, 0.0, 0.0]		    # low limits on the params
    hilim = [+10.0, 5.0, 5.0]		    # high limits
    model.setLimits( lolim, hilim )	    # use UniformPrior with limits

The likelihood is calculated by the **GaussErrorDistribution**. By
default it has a fixed scale. However in most real cases ( see [noise2
example](#../examples/noise2.ipynb) )  it is better to treat the scale
as a hyperparameter, which needs a prior, by default a
**JeffreysPrior**, and limits.

    limits = [0.01, 10]
    ns = NestedSampler( xdata, model, ydata, limits=limits )	

We execute the program as

    logE = ns.sample()

where `logE` is the 10log of the evidence.

After the call to `sample()` optimal parameters, standard deviations, scale and the
optimal fit of the model are available from **NestedSampler**.

    param = ns.parameters
    stdev = ns.standardDeviations
    scale = ns.scale
    yfit  = ns.modelfi

The values are actually obtained from the **SampleList**, a list of
**Sample**s, that is the other result of the **NestedSampler**.
From the **SampleList** numerous items can be extracted.

    slist = ns.samples
    param = slist.parameters		## same as params above
    mlpar = slist.maxLikelihoodParameters

In the examples directory the use of **NestedSampler** is demonstrated
in [HD2039](#../examples/HD2039.ipynb) and
[outliers2](#../examples/outliers-2.ipynb).


### Samples and SampleList

A **Sample** is a collection of items.

+ id : int<br>
    identity of the sample.
+ parent : int<br>
    id of the parent of this sample.
+ model : Model<br>
    the model being used.
+ parameters : array_like<br>
    list of model parameters.
+ hyper : array_like (optional)<br>
    list of hyper parameters from the **ErrorDistribution**.
+ nuisance : array_like (optional)<br>
    list of nuisance parameters from **ErrorsInXandYProblem**.
+ logL : float<br>
    log Likelihood = log Prob( data | params )
+ logW : float<br>
    log weight. Relative weight of this sample.
+ fitIndex : None or array_like<br>
    list of all parameters to be fitted; None is all.

**Sample**s can be collected in a **SampleList**.
The resulting samples from the posterior are collected in a **SampleList**.

When using the samples of the posterior for other purposes than are
provided in **SampleList**, all items derived from individual
**Sample**s should be weighted with

    weight = exp( sample.logW )

before averaging them.
    
### Walkers and WalkerList.

The internal ensemble of trial points is designed as a **WalkerList**, 
or a list of **Walker**s. **Walker**s are similar to **Sample**s, except 
that they have a **Problem** in stead of a **Model**.

The number of walkers can be set with the `ensemble` keyword. By default
`ensemble=100`. The number of walkers that are discarded in every
iteration can be set with `discard`. By default `discard=1`. When
discard is greater than 1, it might be profitable to set the keyword
`threads=True` to randomize each walker in a separate thread. And
finally the keyword `maxsize` can be used to limit the amount of
resulting samples. When the size of the sample list is larger than
maxsize, the samples with the smallest weights are thrown out. By
default `maxsize=None`.

    ns = NestedSampler( xdata, model, ydata, ensemble=200, discard=5,
                        threads=True, maxsize=5000 ) 


### Prior

Before **NestedSampler** can be started with `ns.sample()` the **Model**
should be provided with **Prior**s for all parameters. The same holds
for the **ErrorDistribution** if it has unknown hyperparameters.

Priors are attributes of the simple model.

    gm = GaussModel()
    amppr = ExponentialPrior( scale=10 )        # prior on amplitude (>0)
    cenpr = UniformPrior( limits=[-1,1] )       # prior on center
    widpr = JeffreysPrior( limits=[0.1, 2] )    # prior on width
    gm.priors = [amppr, centpr, widpr]          # set the priors
    
The default prior for model parameters is the **UniformPrior**. The
**UniformPrior** needs limits: low and high. When a **Model** is
provided with limits it sets the priors as **UniformPrior** with the limits.

    low = [0.0, 2.0, -10]           # lower limits
    high = [10, 10, 10]             # upper limits; high[k]>low[k] forall k
    model.setLimits( low, high )    # makes list of 3 uniformPriors with limits

When the model has more parameters than the length of the limits cq.
priors, the last one is repeated for all remaining parameters. 

The priors are attributes of the simple models. In compound models the
priors are taken from the constituent simple models, including the
repetition of the last prior. So priors should be set, before using the
simple model in a compound one. 

See below for lists of available [**Prior**s](#list-priors).

### ErrorDistribution

The **ErrorDistribution** determines the likelihood function.

Except the **PoissonErrorDistribution** all others have one or more
**HyperParameter**s which are governed by a **Prior**, unless they
are known in advance.

    dis = GaussErrorDistribution( )
    dis.setLimits( [0.1, 1.0] )
    ns = NestedSampler( xdata, model, ydata, distribution=dis )

Since version 2.0 the **ErrorDistribution**s has changed its interface.
Previously it was called as `GaussErrorDistribution( xdata, ydata )`.
Now the resposiblities of ErrorDistribution and Problem are better separated. 

The use of e mixture of 2 error distributions is shown in
[outliers2](#../examples/outliers-2.ipynb).

See below for lists of available [**ErrorDistribution**s](#list-errdis).

### Problem

The **Problem** classes have been introduced in version 2.0. They are
meant to broaden the applicability of NestedSampler beyond the classic
problems that we addressed before. A **Problem** collects all items that 
are needed to solve the problem, where the parameters constitute the
solution. 

A **ClassicProblem** consists of a parameterized model with a list of
measured data at the locations of the indepemdent variables. Optionally
there are weights. The **ClassicProblem** is invoked by default.

Other **Problem**s need to be separately invoked.

    problem = ErrorsInXandYProblem( model, xdata, ydata )
    ns = NestedSampler( problem=problem )
    evidence = ns.sample()

See below for lists of available [**Problem**s](#list-problems). 
More **Problem**s can be expected in later versions.
 

### Engine

An **Engine** is piece of programming that moves a walker around in
parameter space such that the resulting walker is distributed randomly
over the priors within the constraint that the likelihood associated
with the walker remains higher than a preselected level.

The engines of choice for continuous parameter estimation are the
**GalileanEngine** and the **ChordEngine**. 

The **GalileanEngine** starts at the copied walker. It selects a random
step in parameter space and moves forward half a dozen times. When a
step trespasses the likelihood boundary it mirrors on the boundary to
get back into allowed space. If that is also unsuccesfull in reverses
its steps.

The **ChordEngine** selects a random direction, though its starting point.
It extends that direction until is is outside the the selected level. 
It selects a random point on the line. If it is inside the level, it is 
the new point. Otherwise replace one of the endpoints and select again.

The initial distribution of the walkers is made by **StartEngine**.

When the model is dynamic, the **BirthEngine** and **DeathEngine** are
added to the engine list to govern the increase and decrease of the
number of parameters.

**Engine**s are selectable in the construction.
The keyword `rate` governs the speed of the engines. High rate equals
high speed equals low accuracy.  

    ns = NestedSampler( xdata, model, ydata, speed=0.5,
                        engines=["galilean", "gibbs", "chord", "step"] )


See below for lists of available [**Engine**s](#list-engines).

### Other keyword arguments

Just like the **Fitter**s **NestedSampler** can have a keywords
`weights` to set weights and `keep` to keep some parameters fixed at a
known value. Both keywords act as in the **Fitter**s.
Also analog to the fitters, the `sample()` method can have the
keywords `keep` and `plot`.

The keyword `verbose` determines how much output the program generates.

+ 0 : silent
+ 1 : basic information. it is the default.
+ 2 : some info about every 100th iteration
+ 3 : some info about every iteration

The keyword `seed` seeds the random number generator, to ensure the same
random sequence each run.

    ns = NestedSampler( xdata, model, ydata, weights=wgts, keep={0:1.0},
                        seed=123456, verbose=2 ) 
    logE = ns.sample( keep={2:3.14}, plot=True )
